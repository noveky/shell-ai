# Shell AI Assistant

An LLM-based smart assistant that integrates with your shell to perform context-aware command execution and provide answers to general questions.

Currently the tool only supports bash.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/noveky/shell-ai.git
    ```

2.  Run the installation script:

    ```bash
    cd shell-ai/
    ./install.sh
    ```

3.  Start a new shell session, or manually source the updated .bashrc file:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

4.  Try it out!

    ```console
    $ ai Why does my system take so long to boot up?
    To diagnose long boot times, you'll want to analyze the system's boot logs for delays. The tool systemd-analyze and systemd-analyze blame are helpful for this.

    systemd-analyze; systemd-analyze blame | head -20; ai proceed

    AI suggests running this command:
      systemd-analyze; systemd-analyze blame | head -20; ai proceed
    Approve? [y/n] y

    Executing approved command (1/1):
      systemd-analyze; systemd-analyze blame | head -20; ai proceed
    Startup finished in 9.688s (firmware) + 6.527s (loader) + 5.306s (kernel) + 23.035s (userspace) = 44.557s
    graphical.target reached after 22.694s in userspace.

    Your boot time is mainly delayed by apt-daily-upgrade.service, which takes over 3 minutes during boot. This is much higher than other services. Disabling or changing the scheduling of this service can significantly reduce your boot time.
